<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>Core Developer on Waggle, SAGE and the Array of Things.</h3>
<h4>Argonne National Lab, since January 2016.</h4>

<p>I work on a wide range of programming and technical problems. My responsibilities have included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Development of bulk and live data publishing and processing pipeline.</li>
    <li>Development of firmware for our system critical embedded systems.</li>
    <li>Improving containerization of software stack for simpler, more reliable deployment and testing.</li>
    <li>Development of community Python and C++ platform libraries.</li>
    <li>Development of assembly line QA tools and software used by our manufacturing partners and technicians.</li>
    <li>Guiding summer interns through the design, implementation and integration of software tools.</li>
    <li>Significant independent investigation of ideas to improve our processes and workflow.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Math and Computer Science Graduate Internship</h3>
<h4>Argonne National Lab, Summer 2015</h4>

<p>I worked on implementing a large scale watershed simulation. This involved knowledge of fluid mechanics and
    hyperbolic PDEs, tool development in Python, and building the simulation on top of PETSc in C.</p>

<h3>Computational Bootcamp Instructor</h3>
<h4>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Summer 2014 and 2015</h4>

<p>I developed and taught an intensive two-week workshop targeting 30 mathematics graduate students interested in
    learning programming and computational skills with Python and Scipy. Material from the most recent workshop can be
    found <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~shahkar2/cbmg/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p><strong>Development.</strong> Experienced in Python, C, C++, Go and many other tools as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Operations.</strong> Linux, Docker, Ansible, RDBMS, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Prometheus</p>
<p><strong>Data Tools.</strong> Numpy, Scipy, Jupyter, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Progress towards Ph.D in Mathematics, 2011-2016, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</li>
    <li>M.S. in Mathematics, 2011-2013, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</li>
    <li>B.A. in Mathematics with Minor in Computer Science, 2007-2011, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</li>
</ul>

			<h1>Sean Shahkarami</h1>

			<p>Hello, I'm Sean, a software developer with a strong background in mathematics.</p>

			<p>I'm an avid developer and have been since about 2004. My formal education is in pure and applied math
				with a strong emphasis on computing. Along the way, I've picked up a many practical skills and developed
				a well-rounded skillset. These days, I'm looking towards the exciting AI/ML space to see what I can do
				there.</p>

			<p>I currently work as a programmer at Argonne National Lab on the <a href="https://wa8.gl">Waggle</a> and
				<a href="https://sagecontinuum.org">Sage</a> projects where I'm helping fuel future science
				by building scientific cyberinfrastructure to support AI/ML applications at the edge.</p>

			<p>I believe that working in a small team has provided me a lot of experience in a short time. I've
				taken ownership of and worked on a wide range of technical problems such as building
				data pipelines with RabbitMQ and Cassandra, developing firmware for embedded systems, developing
				interactive QA software for our hardware assembly process, and much more.</p>

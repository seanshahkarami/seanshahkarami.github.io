		<h1>Sean Shahkarami</h1>

		<p>Hello, I'm Sean, a software developer with a strong background in mathematics.</p>

		<p>I'm an avid developer and have been since about 2004. My formal education is in pure and applied math
			with a strong emphasis on computing. Along the way, I've picked up a many practical skills and developed
			a well-rounded skillset. These days, I'm looking towards the exciting AI/ML space to see what I can do
			there.</p>

		<p>I currently work as a software developer at Argonne National Lab on the <a href="https://wa8.gl">Waggle</a>
			and
			<a href="https://sagecontinuum.org">Sage</a> projects where I'm helping fuel future science
			by building scientific cyberinfrastructure to support AI/ML applications at the edge.</p>

<h1>Sean Shahkarami</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Sean, a software developer who likes working on cool problems.</p>

<p>I've been an avid programmer since about 2004. My formal education is in pure and applied math
	with a strong emphasis on computing. Along the way, I've worked on lots of different problems which
	has helped me develop a well-rounded skillset. These days, I'm looking forward to what I can do in the
	exciting AI/ML space.</p>

<p>I'm currently a software developer at Argonne National Lab for the <a href="https://wa8.gl">Waggle</a>
	and <a href="https://sagecontinuum.org">Sage</a> projects where I'm helping fuel future science
	by building scientific cyberinfrastructure for AI/ML applications at the edge.</p>

Hello! I’m Sean Shahkarami!

I’m a software engineer and have been an avid programmer since the mid 2000s where I wrote Ruby code to make MMOs in RPG Maker XP. My formal education is in pure and applied math with a strong emphasis on computing.

Along the way, I’ve worked on lots of different problems which has helped me develop a well-rounded skillset. These days, I’m looking forward to what I can do in the exciting AI/ML space.

I currently lead the software team for the [Waggle](https://wa8.gl/) and [Sage](https://sagecontinuum.org/) projects at Argonne National Lab where I’m helping fuel future science by building scientific cyberinfrastructure for AI/ML applications at the edge.

If you'd like to chat sometime, you can [email](mailto:sean.shahkarami@gmail.com) me or find me on [Github](https://github.com/seanshahkarami). You can also take a look at my [resume](/resume).

<h1>Random</h1>

<p>These are things I've created that I think are cool.</p>

<h3><a href="mooseheart.html">Mooseheart</a></h3>
<p>A cute "screensaver" which generates a random night sky each time you click on it.</p>

<h3><a href="tracy.html">Tracy</a></h3>
<p>A basic ray tracer which displays some nice looking metallic spheres.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/seanshahkarami/seanshahkarami.github.io/blob/main/docs/noice.py">Noice</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.streamlit.io">Streamlit</a> example of generating cool images from random noise. To run
	it, you'll need make sure you have the required packages, then you can use "streamlit run" directly from the
	web.</p>
<p><small>
		<tt>pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib streamlit</tt><br />

<h3><a href="https://github.com/seanshahkarami/docker-image-pull-size">Docker Data Pull Estimator</a></h3>

<p>This is a tool I wrote to (approximately) answer the question "How much data will be downloaded when pulling a series
	of
	Docker images?"</p>

<p>The interesting bit of this is keeping track of the shared layers between images and giving
	a useful summary to the user at each step.</p>

<p>This was motivated at my job with the <a href="https://sagecontinuum.org/">Sage</a> project. Our team and users
	build on top of a core set of Docker base images. Some of are quite large (~5GB), so we try to preload them on our
	edge devices to reduce network bandwidth. This tool allowed me to quickly simulate the data cost of a series of
	pulls with various preload strategies.</p>

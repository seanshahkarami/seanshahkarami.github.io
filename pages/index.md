Hello! I'm Sean Shahkarami!

I'm a software developer and have been an avid programmer since about 2004. My formal education is in pure and
applied math with a strong emphasis on computing. Along the way, I've worked on lots
of different problems which has helped me develop a well-rounded skillset. These days,
I'm looking forward to what I can do in the exciting AI/ML space.

I'm currently a software developer at Argonne National Lab for the [Waggle](https://wa8.gl)
and [Sage](https://sagecontinuum.org) projects where I'm helping fuel future science
by building scientific cyberinfrastructure for AI/ML applications at the edge.

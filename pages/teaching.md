### [CBMG 2015](cbmg-2015/index.html)

This is material for a two week intensive course on programming and scientific computing I developed
and led in summer 2015 for math grad students at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

If you find it useful, please let me know! I'd love to hear that others have benefited from it beyond
just my class. Sadly, the original notebooks have been lost, so only the HTML renderings remain.

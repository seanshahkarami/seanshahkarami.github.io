<p>This is material for a two week intensive course on programming and scientific computing I developed and led
	in summer 2015 for math grad students at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>If you find it useful, please let me know! I'd love to hear that others have benefited
	from it beyond just my class. Sadly, the original notebooks have been lost, so only the HTML renderings
	remain.</p>
